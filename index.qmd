# Welcome {.unnumbered}

Welcome! This is the initial page for the "Open Access" HTML version of the book "Introduction to Zig: an project based book",
written by [Pedro Duarte Faria](https://pedro-faria.netlify.app/).
This is an open book that provides an introduction to the [Zig programming language](https://ziglang.org/),
which is a new general-purpose, and low-level language for building robust and optimal software.

## About this book {.unnumbered}

This an open book, meaning that, it is open-source, and it will always be open
for anyone that wants to read it. However, this book is still under construction ðŸš§ and active development,
so, it's contents might change drastically in the near future.

Also, this is a project-based book, which means that we learn how to use the Zig programming language
through small and simple projects, in a similar style to the famous "Python Crash Course" book from Eric Matthes.
