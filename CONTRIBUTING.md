# Contributing

There are some different ways for you to contribute to this project:

-   If you don't understand something, or, if a particular section of the book seems
    confusing to you, you can [create an issue and give a feedback, or, a suggestion of improvement](https://github.com/pedropark99/zig-book/issues).

-   If you spot a typo anywhere in the book, feel free to edit the underlying QMD file (QMD files are inside the [`Chapters` folder](https://github.com/pedropark99/zig-book/tree/main/Chapters)) and send a pull request.
    If you've never done this before, the process is very easy:

    -   Click the edit this page on the sidebar.

    -   Make the changes using GitHub's in-page editor and save.

    -   Submit a pull request and include a brief description of your changes.
        "Fixing typos" is perfectly adequate.

If you send a Pull Request with significant changes, include the phrase "I assign the copyright of this contribution
to Pedro Duarte Faria" in the description of your Pull Request - I need this so I can publish the book.
