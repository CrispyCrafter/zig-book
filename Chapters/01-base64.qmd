# Building a base64 encoder/decoder

As our first small project, I want to implement with you a base64 encoder/decoder in Zig.
Base64 is an encoding system which translates binary data to text.
A big chunk of the web uses base64 to deliver binary data to systems
that can only read text data.

The biggest example of a modern use case for base64 is essentially any email system,
like GMail, Outlook, etc. Because email systems normally use
the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), which is a web protocol
that supports only text data. So, if you need, for any reason, to
send a binary file (like for example, a PDF, or an Excel file) as
an attachment in your email, these binary files are normally
converted to base64, before they are included in the SMTP message.
So, the base64 encoding is largelly used in these email systems to include
binary data into the SMTP message.






## How the base64 algorithm work? 

Now, how exactly the algorithm behind the base64 encoding works? Let's discuss that. First, I will
explain the base64 scale, which is the scale of 64 characters that represents the base64 encoding system.

After that, I explain the algorithm behind a base64 encoder, which is the part of the algorithm that is responsible for encoding messages
into the base64 encoding system. Then, after that, I explain the algorithm behind a base64 decoder, which is
the part of the algorithm that is responsible for translating base64 messages back into their original meaning.

If you are unsure about the differences between an "encoder" and a "decoder",
take a look at @sec-encode-vs-decode.


### The base64 scale

In essence, the base64 encoding system is based on a scale that goes from 0 to 64 (hence the name).
Each index in this scale is represented by a character (it is a scale of 64 characters).
So, in order to convert some binary data, to the base64 encoding, we need to convert each binary number to the corresponding
character in this "scale of 64 characters".

The base64 scale starts with all ASCII uppercase letters (A to Z) which represents
the first 25 indexes in this scale (0 to 25). After that, we have all ASCII lowercase letters
(a to z), which represents the range 26 to 51 in the scale. After that, we
have the one digit numbers (0 to 9), which represents the indexes from 52 to 61 in the scale.
Finally, the last two indexes in the scale (62 and 63) are represented by the characters `+` and `/`,
respectively.

These are the 64 characters that compose the base64 scale. The equal sign character (`=`) is not part of the scale itself,
but it is a special character in the base64 encoding system. This character is used solely as a suffix, to mark the end of the character sequence,
or, to mark the end of meaningful characters in the sequence.

The bulletpoints below summarises the base64 scale:

- range 0 to 25 is represented by: ASCII uppercase letters `-> [A-Z]`;
- range 26 to 51 is represented by: ASCII lowercase letters `-> [a-z]`;
- range 52 to 61 is represented by: one digit numbers `-> [0-9]`;
- index 62 and 63 are represented by the characters `+` and `/`, respectively;
- the character `=` represents the end of meaningful characters in the sequence;



Everytime that the base64 algorithm needs to fill some gap (which always occur at the end of
the input string) with a group of 6 bits filled with only zeros (`000000`), this group is automatically
mapped to the character `=`. Because this group of 6 bits is meaningless, they represent nothing,
they are just filling the gap. As a result, the base64 algorithm maps this meaningless group
to the character `=`, which represents the end of meaningful characters in the sequence.
This characteristic is explained in more details at @sec-base64-encoder-algo.



### Creating the scale as a lookup table

The best way to represent this scale in code, is to represent it as a *lookup table*.
Lookup tables are a classic strategy in computer science to speed calculations. The basic idea
is to replace a runtime calculation (which can take a long time to be done) by a basic array indexing
operation.

Instead of calculating the results everytime you need them, you calculate all possible results at once, and then, you store them in an array
(which behaves lake a "table"). Then, every time that you need to use one of the characters in the base64 scale, instead of
using many resources to calculate the exact character to be used, you simply retrieve this character
from the array where you stored all the possible characters in the base64 scale. So we retrieve the character that we need
directly from memory.

We can start building a Zig struct to store our base64 decoder/encoder logic.
We start with the `Base64` struct below. You can see that, for now, we only have an `init()` function,
to create a new instance of a `Base64` object, and, a `_char_at()` function, which is a
"get chat at index ..." type of function.


```{zig}
#| eval: false
const Base64 = struct {
    _table: *const [64]u8,

    pub fn init() Base64 {
        const upper = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
        const lower = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";
        const numbers_symb = "0123456789+/";
        return Base64{
            ._table = upper ++ lower ++ numbers_symb,
        };
    }

    pub fn _char_at(self: Base64, index: u8) u8 {
        return self._table[index];
    }
};
```


In other words, the `_char_at()` function is responsible for getting the character in the lookup table (i.e. the `_table` variable) that
corresponds to a particular index in the "base64 scale". So, in the example below, we know that
the character that corresponds to the index 28 in the "base64 scale" is the character "c".


```{zig}
#| eval: false
const base64 = Base64.init();
try stdout.print(
    "Character at 28 index: {c}\n",
    .{base64._char_at(28)}
);
```

```
Character at 28 index: c
```



### A base64 encoder {#sec-base64-encoder-algo}

The algorithm behind a base64 encoder usually works on a window of 3 bytes. Because each byte have
8 bits, so, 3 bytes forms a set of $8 \times 3 = 24$ bits. This is desirable for the base64 algorithm, because
24 bits is divisble by 6, which form a set of 4 groups of 6 bits each.

So the base64 algorithm work by converting 3 bytes at a time
into 4 characters in the base64 scale. It keeps iterating through the input string,
3 bytes at a time, and converting them into the base64 scale, producing 4 characters
per iteration. It keeps iterating, and producing these "new characters"
until it hits the end of the input string.

Now you may think, what if you have a particular string that have a number of bytes
that is not divisible by 3? What happens? For example, if you have a string
that contains only two characters/bytes, such as "Hi". How the
algorithm behaves in such situation? You find the answer at @fig-base64-algo1.
You can see at @fig-base64-algo1 that the string "Hi", when converted to base64,
becomes the string "SGk=":

![The logic behind a base64 encoder](./../Figures/base64-encoder-flow.png){#fig-base64-algo1}

In the example of the string "Hi" we have 2 bytes, or, 16 bits in total. So, we lack a full byte (8 bits)
to complete the window of 24 bits that the base64 algorithm likes to work on. In essence,
everytime that the algorithm does not meet this requirement, it simply add extra zeros
until it fills the space that it needs.

That is why at @fig-base64-algo1, on the third group after the 6-bit transformation,
2 extra zeros were added to fill the gap in this group, and also, the fourth group (which is the last 6-bit group)
after the 6-bit transformation is entirely made by zeros that were added by the algorithm.

So every time that the base64 algorithm can't produce a full group of 6 bits, it
simply fills the gap in this group with zeros, until it get's the 6 bits that it needs.

Is worth mentioning that, everytime that the algorithm produces a group of 6 bits that
is entirely composed by zeros, this group of 6 bits is automatically mapped to
the character `=` (equal sign). In other works, the group `000000` is translated into the
character `=`. Because it represents the end of meaningful characters in the sequence.


### A base64 decoder {#sec-base64-decoder-algo}

The algorithm behind a base64 decoder is essentially the inverse process of a base64 encoder.
A base64 decoder needs to be able to translate base64 messages back into their original meaning,
i.e. into the original sequence of binary data.

A base64 decoder usually works on a window of 4 bytes. Because it wants to convert these 4 bytes
back into the original sequence of 3 bytes, that was converted into 4 groups of 6 bits by the
base64 encoder. Remember, in a base64 decoder we are essentially reverting the process made
by the base64 encoder.

Each byte in the input string (the base64 encoded string) normally contributes to re-create two different bytes in the output (the original binary data).
In other words, each byte that comes out of a base64 decoder is created by transforming merging two different
bytes in the input together. You can see this fact at @fig-base64-algo2:

![The logic behind a base64 decoder](./../Figures/base64-decoder-flow.png){#fig-base64-algo2}

The exact transformations, or, the exact steps applied to each byte from the input to transform them
into the bytes in the output, are a bit tricky to visualize in a figure like this. Because of that, I
summarized these transformations as "Some bit shifting and additions ...". These transformations
will be described in depth later.

Besides that, if you look again at @fig-base64-algo2, you will notice that the character `=` was completly
ignored in the algorithm. Remember, this is just a special character that marks the end of meaninful characters
in the base64 sequence. So, every `=` character in a base64 encoded sequence should be ignored.


## Difference between encode and decode {#sec-encode-vs-decode}

If you don't have any previous experience with base64, you might be confused about
what is the differente between "encode" and "decode". Essentially, the terms "encode" and "decode" here
have the exact same meaning as they have in the field of encryption (i.e. they mean the same thing as "encode" and "decode" in hashing
algorithms, like the MD5 algorithm).

So, "encode" means that we want to encode, or, in other words, we want to translate some message into
the base64 encoding system. We want to produce the sequence of base64 characters that represent this
original message in the base64 encoding system.

In contrast, "decode" represents the inverse process.
We want to decode, or, in other words, translate a base64 message back to it's original content.
So, in this process we get a sequence of base64 characters as input, and produce as output,
the binary data that is represented by this sequence of base64 characters.

So, any base64 library is normally composed by these two parts: 1) the encoder, which is a function that encodes
(i.e. it converts) any sequence of binary data into a sequence of base64 characters; 2) the decoder, which is a function
that converts a sequence of base64 characters back into the original sequence of binary data.



## Calculating the size of the output

One task that we need to do is to calculate how much space we need to reserve for the
output of the encoder.

```{zig}
#| eval: false
const Base64 = struct {
    _table: *const [64]u8,
}
```
