# Structs, Modules and Control Flow

We are going to discuss a lot of different things in
this chapter. First, we bring structs and modules into focus.
Then, we talk about modules, and how they relate to structs in Zig.
Finally, we end this chapter discussing all the different keywords and structures
in Zig related to control flow (like loops and if statements).
