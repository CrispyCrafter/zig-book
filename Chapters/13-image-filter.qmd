# Project 4 - Developing an image filter

In this chapter we are going to build a new small project. The objective of
this project is to build a program in Zig that applies a filter over an image.
More specifically, a "grayscale filter". This filter essentially transforms
any color image into a grayscale image.

We are going to use the image displayed at @fig-pascal as the example in this project.
In other words, we are going to transform this colored image, into a grayscale image,
using our "image filter program" written in Zig.

We don't need to write a lot of code to build such "image filter program". However, in order for us
to build such program, we need to understand how digital images work. That is why we begin this chapter
by explaining the theory behind digital images and how colors are represented in modern computers.
We also give a brief explanation about the file format PNG (Portable Network Graphics), which is used
in the example images.

At the end of this chapter, we will have a full example of a program that takes the PNG image displayed at @fig-pascal
as input, and writes a new image to the current working directory that is the grayscale version of the input image.
This grayscale version of @fig-pascal that is written by the program is exposed at @fig-pascal-gray.

## How we see things? {#sec-eyes}

In this section, I want to briefly describe to you how we (humans) actually see things with our own eyes.
I mean, how our eyes work? If you do have a very basic understanding of how our eyes work, you will understand
more easily how digital images are made. Because the techniques used to produce a digital image
were developed by taking a lot of inspiration from how our human eyes work.

You can interpret a human eye as a light sensor, or, a light receptor. The eye receives some amount of light as input,
and it interprets the colors that are present in this "amount of light".
If no amount of light hits the eye, then, the eye cannot extract color from it, and as result,
we end up seeing nothing, or, more precisely, we see complete blackness.

So everything depends on light. What we actually see are the colors (blue, red, orange, green, etc.) that
are being reflected from the light that is hitting our eyes. **Light is the source of all colors!**
This is what Isaac Newton discovered on his famous prism experiment[^newton] in the 1660s.

[^newton]: <https://library.si.edu/exhibition/color-in-a-new-light/science>

Inside our eyes, we have a specific type of cell called the "cone cell".
Our eye have three different types, or, three different versions of these "cone cells".
Each of these three types of cone cell is very sensitive to a specific spectrum of the light,
which are the spectrums that define the colors red, green and blue.
So, in summary, our eyes have specific types of cells that
are highly sensitive to the colors red, green and blue.

These are the cells responsible for perceiving the color present in the light that hits our eyes.
As a result, our eyes perceives color as a mixture of these colors (red, green and blue). By having an amount
of each one of these three colors, and mixing them together, we can get any other visible color
that we want. So every color that we see is perceived as a specific mixture of blues, greens and reds,
like 30% of red, plus 20% of green, plus 50% of blue.

When these cone cells perceive (or, detect) the colors that are found in the
light that is hitting our eyes, these cells produce electrical signals and sent them to the brain.
Our brain interprets these electrical signals, and use them to form the image that we are seeing
inside our head. Perceive the colors present in light.

Based on what we have discussed here, the items below describes the sequence of events that
composes this simplified version of how our human eyes work:

1. Light hits our eyes.
1. The cone cells perceive the colors that are present in this light.
1. Cone cells produce electrical signals that describes the colors that were perceived in the light.
1. The electrical signals are sent to the brain.
1. Brain interprets these signals, and form the image based on the colors identified by these electrical signals.


## How digital images work? {#sec-digital-img}

A digital image is a "digital representation" of an image that we see with our eyes.
In other words, a digital image is a "digital representation" of the colors that we see
and perceive through the light.

In the digital world, we have two types of images, which are: vector image and raster image.
Vector images are not described here. So just remember that every single aspect that we discuss
here in this chapter about digital images **are related solely to raster images**, and not vector images.

Raster images are digital images that are represented as a 2D (two dimensional) matrix
of pixels. In other words, every raster image is basically a 2D rectangle of pixels. Each pixel have a particular color.
So, the raster image is just a matrix of pixels, and each of these pixels are displayed in the screen of your computer (or the screen
of any other device, e.g. laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc.) as colors.

For example, if the digital image have dimensions of 1920 pixels of width and 1080 pixels of height, then, the image
contains $1920 \times 1080 = 2073600$ pixels in total. You could also say that the "total area" of the image is
of 2073600 pixels, although the concept of "area" is not very used here in computer graphics.

Since most digital images uses the RGB model, the color of each pixel in these raster images are usually
represented as a mixture of red, green and blue. That is, the color of each pixel is identified by a set of
three different integer values. Each integer value identifies the "amount" of each color (red, green or blue).
For example, the set `(199, 78, 70)` identifies a color that is very close to red. We have 199 of red, 78 of green,
and 70 of blue (RGB).



### Matrix of pixels

Ok, we know already that digital images are represented as a 2D matrix of pixels.
But we do not have a notion of a 2D matrix in Zig. Most low-level languages in general (Zig, C, Rust, etc.) do not have such notion.
As consequence, a 2D matrix is usually represented in low-level languages inside a 1D array.
You just create an normal 1D array, and store all values from both dimensions into this 1D array.

When we use such strategy, indexing values from a specific dimension becomes a little harder.
But with some basic math we can solve this problem. As an example, let's use a very small image of 5x5 pixels,
which have 25 pixels in total, that is represented by $3 \times 25 = 75$ integer values.
So, we need to create an array of 75 unsigned 8-bit integer (`u8`) values to store the 2D matrix of pixels
of this particular image.

To represent the amounts of each color, unsigned 8-bit integer (`u8`) values because they take the minimum amount
of space as possible, which reduces the binary size of the image, i.e. of the 2D matrix.
