# Data Structures

In this chapter, we are going to discuss some Data Structures that are available from
the Zig Standard Library, specially `ArrayList` and also `HashMap`. I'm also want
to talk about one of the key features of Zig in this chapter, which is `comptime`, and
how we can use it to create generics in Zig.


## Dynamic Arrays

In high level languages, arrays are usually dynamic. They easily grow
in size when they have to, and you don't need to worry about it.
In contrast, arrays in low level languages are usually static by default.
This is the reality of C, C++, Rust and also Zig. Static arrays were presented at
@sec-arrays, but in this section, we are going to talk about dynamic arrays.

Dynamic arrays are simply arrays that can grow in size during the runtime
of your program. Most low level languages offer some implementation of
a dynamic array in their standard library. C++ have `std::vector`, Rust have `Vec`,
and Zig have `std.ArrayList`.

The `std.ArrayList` struct provides a contiguous and growable array for you.
It works like any other dinamic array, it allocates a contiguous block of memory, and when this block have no space left,
`ArrayList` allocates another contiguous and bigger block of memory, copies the
elements to this new location, and erases (or frees) the previous block of memory.


### Capacity vs Length

When we talk about dynamic arrays, we have two similar concepts that
are very essential to how a dynamic array works behind the hood.
These concepts are *capacity* and *length*. In some contexts, specially
in C++, *length* is also called of *size*.

Although they look similar, these concepts represent different things
in the context of dynamic arrays. *Capacity* is the number of items (or elements)
that your dynamic array can currently hold without the need to allocate more memory.

In contrast, the *length* refers to how many elements in the array
are currently being used, or, in other words, how many elements in this array
that you assigned a value to. Every dynamic array works around
a block of allocated memory that represents an array with total capacity of $n$ elements,
but only a portion of these $n$ elements are being used most of the time. This portion
of $n$ is the *length* of the array. So every time you append a new value
to the array, you are incrementing it's *length* by one.

This means that a dynamic array usually works with an extra margin, or, an extra space
which is currently empty, but it is waiting and ready to be used. This "extra space"
is essentially the difference between *capacity* and *length*. *Capacity* represents
the total number of elements that the array can hold without the need to re-allocate
or re-expand the array, while the *length* represents how much of this capacity
is currently being used to hold/store values.

When *length* and *capacity* are equal, it means that the array have no space left.
We reached the roof of our capacity, and because of that, if we want to store more values
in this array, we need to expand it. We need to get a bigger space that can hold more values
that we currently have.

A dynamic array works by expanding the underlying array, whenever the *length* becomes equal
to the *capacity* of the array. It basically allocates a new contiguos block of memory that is bigger
than the previous one, then, it copies all values that are currently being stored to this new
location (i.e. this new block of memory), then, it frees the previous block of
memory. At the end of this process, the new underlying array have a bigger *capacity*, and, therefore,
the *length* becomes once again smaller than the *capacity* of the array.

This is the cycle of an dynamic array. Notice that, throughout this cycle, the *capacity* is always
either equal to or higher than the *length* of the array. If youh have an `ArrayList` object, let's suppose
you named it of `buffer`, you can check the current capacity of your array by accessing the `capacity`
attribute of your `ArrayList` object, while the current *length* of it is available through the `items.len`
attribute of your `ArrayList` object.


```{zig}
#| eval: false
// Check capacity
buffer.capacity;
// Check length
buffer.items.len;
```

### Creating an `ArrayList` object

In order to use `ArrayList`, you must provide an allocator object to it.
Remember, Zig does not have a default memory allocator. And as I described at @sec-allocators, all memory
allocations must be done by allocator objects that you define, that
you have control over. In our example here, I'm going to use
a general purpose allocator, but you can use any other allocator
of your preference.

When you initialize an `ArrayList` object, you must provide the data type of the elements of
the array. In other words, this defines the type of data that this array (or container) will
store. Therefore, if I provide the `u8` type to it, then, I will create a dynamic
array of `u8` values. However, if I provide a struct that I defined instead, like the struct `User`
from @sec-structs-and-oop, then, a dynamic array of `User` values
will be created. In the example below, with the expression `ArrayList(u8)` we
are creating a dynamic array of `u8` values.

After you provide the data type of the elements of the array, you can initialize
an `ArrayList` object by either using the `init()` or the `initCapacity()` method.
The former method receives only the allocator object
as input, while the latter method receives both the allocator object and a capacity number as inputs.
With the latter method, you not only initialize the struct, but you
also set the starting capacity of the allocated array.

Using the `initCapacity()` method is the preferred way to initialize your dynamic array.
Because reallocations, or, in other words, the process of expanding the capacity of the array,
is always a high cost operation. You should take any possible opportunity to avoid reallocations in
your array. If you know how much space your array needs to occupy at the beginning,
you should always use `initCapacity()` to create your dynamic array.


```{zig}
#| auto_main: true
var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};
const allocator = gpa.allocator();
var buffer = try std.ArrayList(u8)
    .initCapacity(allocator, 100);
defer buffer.deinit();
```


In the example above, the `buffer` object starts as an array of 100 elements. If this
`buffer` object needs to create more space to accomodate more elements during the runtime of your program, the `ArrayList`
internals will perform the necessary actions for you automatically.
Also notice the `deinit()` method being used to destroy the `buffer` object at the
end of the current scope, by freeing all the memory that was allocated for the dynamic
array stored in this `buffer` object.


### Adding new elements to the array

Now that we created our dynamic array, we can start to use it. You can append (a.k.a "add")
new values to this array by using the `append()` method. This method works the same way
as the `append()` method from a Python list, or, the `emplace_back()` method from `std::vector` of C++.
You provide a single value to this method, and the method appends this value to the array.

You can also use the `appendSlice()` method to append multiple values at once. You provide
a slice (slices were described at @sec-arrays) to this method, and the method adds all values present
in this slice to your dynamic array.

```{zig}
#| eval: false
try buffer.append('H');
try buffer.append('e');
try buffer.append('l');
try buffer.append('l');
try buffer.append('o');
try buffer.appendSlice(" World!");
```

### Removing elements from the array {#sec-dynamic-array-remove}

You can use the `pop()` method to "pop" or remove
the last element in the array. Is worth noting that this method
do not change the capacity of the array. It just deletes or erases
the last value stored in the array.

Also, this method returns as result the value that got deleted. That is, you can
use this method to both get the last value in the array, and also, remove
it from the array. It is a "get and remove value" type of method.

```{zig}
#| eval: false
const exclamation_mark = buffer.pop();
```

Now, if you want to remove specific elements from specific positions
of your array, you can use the `orderedRemove()` method from your
`ArrayList` object. With this method, you can provide an index as input,
then, the method will delete the value that is at this index in the array.
This effectively reduces the *length* of the array everytime you execute
an `orderedRemove()` operation.

In the example below, we first create an `ArrayList` object, and we fill it
with numbers. Then, we use `orderedRemove()` to remove the value at
index 3 in the array, two consecutive times.

Also, notice that we are assigning the result of `orderedRemove()` to the
underscore character. So we are discarding the result value of this method.
As the result value, the `orderedRemove()` method returns the value that
got deleted, in a similar style to the `pop()` method.


```{zig}
#| auto_main: true
#| eval: true
var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};
const allocator = gpa.allocator();
var buffer = try std.ArrayList(u8)
    .initCapacity(allocator, 100);
defer buffer.deinit();

for (0..10) |i| {
    const index: u8 = @intCast(i);
    try buffer.append(index);
}

std.debug.print(
    "{any}\n", .{buffer.items}
);
_ = buffer.orderedRemove(3);
_ = buffer.orderedRemove(3);

std.debug.print(
    "{any}\n", .{buffer.items}
);
std.debug.print(
    "{any}\n", .{buffer.items.len}
);
```

```
{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 }
{ 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 }
8
```

One key characteristic about `orderedRemove()` is that it preserves the order
of the values in the array. So, it deletes the value that you asked it to
remove, but it also makes sure that the order of the values that remain in the array
stay the same as before.

Now, if you don't care about the order of the values, for example, maybe you want to treat
your dynamic array as a set of values, like the `std::unordered_set`
structure from C++, you can use the `swapRemove()` method instead. This method
works similarly to the `orderedRemove()` method. You give an index to this
method, then, it deletes the value that is at this index in the array.
But this method does not preserve the original order of the values that remain
in the array. As a result, `swapRemove()` is, in general, faster than `orderedRemove()`.


### Inserting elements at specific indexes

When you need to insert values in the middle of your array,
instead of just appending them to the end of the array, you need to use
the `insert()` and `insertSlice()` methods, instead of
the `append()` and `appendSlice()` methods.

These two methods work very similarly to `insert()` and `insert_range()`
from the C++ vector class. You provide an index to these methods,
and they insert the values that you provide at that index in the array.

```{zig}
#| auto_main: true
var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};
const allocator = gpa.allocator();
var buffer = try std.ArrayList(u8)
    .initCapacity(allocator, 10);
defer buffer.deinit();

try buffer.appendSlice("My Pedro");
try buffer.insert(4, '3');
try buffer.insertSlice(2, " name");
for (buffer.items) |char| {
    try stdout.print("{c}", .{char});
}
```

```
My name P3edro
```


### Conclusion

If you feel the lack of some other method, I recommend
you to read the [official documentation for the `ArrayListAligned`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#std.array_list.ArrayListAligned)[^zig-array]
struct, which describes most of the methods available
through the `ArrayList` object.

You will notice that there is a lot other methods in this page that
I did not described here, and I recommend you to explore these methods,
and understand how they work.

## Maps or HashTables

Some professionals know this type of data structure by different terms, like "map", "hashmap" or "associative arrays". But most professionals
know this structure by the name *hashtable*.
Every programming language normally have some implementation of a hashtable in their
stardard libraries. Python have `dict()`, C++ have `std::map` and `std::unordered_map`, Rust
have `HashMap`, Javascript have `Object()` and `Map()`,
C# have `Hashtable()`, etc.



### What is a hashtable?

A hashtable is a data structure based on key-value pairs.
You provide a key and a value to this structure, then, the hashtable will store
the input value at a location that can be identified by the input
key that you provided.
It does that by using an underlying array and a hash function.
These two components are essential to how a hashtable works.

Under the hood, the hashtable contains an array. This array is where the values
are stored, and the elements of this array are usually called of *buckets*.
So the values that you provide to the hashtable are stored inside buckets,
and you access each bucket by using an index.

When you provide a key to a hashtable, it passes this key to the
hash function. This hash function uses some sort of hashing algorithm to transform
this key into an index. This index is actually an array index. It is a position
in the underlying array of the hashtable.
This is how a key identifies a specific position (or location) inside the hashtable
structure.

So you provide a key to the hashtable, and this key identifies an specific location
inside the hastable, then, the hashtable takes the input value that you provided,
and stores this value in the location identified by the input key that you provided.
You could say that the key maps to the value stored in the hashtable. You find
the value, by using the key that identifies the location where the value is stored.
The @fig-hashtable presents this process visually.


![A diagram of a Hashtable. Source: Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.](./../Figures/hashtable.svg){#fig-hashtable}


The operation described in the previous paragraph is normally called an *insertion* operation.
Because you are inserting new values into the hashtable.
But there are other types of operations in hashtables such as *delete* and *lookup*.
Delete is self describing, it is when you delete (or remove) a value from the hashtable.
While lookup corresponds to when you retrieve (or look at) a value that is stored in
the hashtable, by using the key that identifies the location where this value is stored.

Sometimes, instead of storing the values directly, the underlying array of the hashtable might be an array of pointers,
i.e. the buckets of the array stores pointers that points to the value,
or also, may be an array of linked lists.
These cases are commom on hashtables that allows duplicate keys, or, in other words,
on hashtables that effectively handle "collisions" that may arise from the hash function.

Duplicate keys, or this "collision" thing that I'm talking about, is when you have two different keys that points to the same location (i.e. to the same index)
in the underlying array of the hashtable. This might happen depending on the characteristics of the hash function
that is being used in the hashtable. Some implementations of the hashtable will actively deal with collisions,
meaning that, they will handle this case in some way. For example, the hashtable
might transform all buckets into linked lists. Because with a liked list you can store
multiple values into a single bucket.

There are different techniques to handle collisions in hashtables, which I will not describe
in this book, because it is not our main scope here. But you can find a good description of
some of the most commom techniques at the Wikipedia page of hashtables [@wikipedia_hashtables].


### Hashtables in Zig {#sec-hashmap}

The Zig Standard Library provides different implementations of a hashtable,
like the struct `HashMap`. Each implementation have it's own cons and pros, which we will
discuss later on, and all of them are available through the `std.hash_map` module.

The `HashMap` struct is a general-purpose hashtable,
which have very fast operations (lookup, insertion, delete), and also,
quite high load factors for low memory usage. You can create and provide a context object
to the `HashMap` constructor. This context object allows you to tailor
the behaviour of the hashtable itself, because you can
provide a hash function implementation to be used by the hashtable
through this context object.

But let's not worry about this context object now, because it is meant to be used
by "experts in the field of hashtables". Since we are most likely not
experts in this field, we are going to take the easy way to create
a hashtable. Which is by using the `AutoHashMap()` function.


This `AutoHashMap()` function is essentially a "create a hashtable object that uses the default settings"
type of function. It chooses a context object, and, therefore, a hash function implementation,
automatically for you. This function receives two data types as input, the first data type is the data type of the keys
that will be used in this hashtable, while the second data type is the data type of that data that will be
stored inside the hashtable, that is, the data type of the values to be stored.

In the example below, we are providing the data type `u32` in the first argument, and `u16` in the second argument of this
function. It means that we are going to use `u32` values as keys in this hashtable, while `u16` values are the actual values
that are going to be stored into this hashtable.
At the end of this process, the `hash_table` object contains a `HashMap` object as output
that uses the default context, and the default load factor.


```{zig}
#| auto_main: false
const std = @import("std");
const AutoHashMap = std.hash_map.AutoHashMap;

pub fn main() !void {
    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};
    const allocator = gpa.allocator();
    var hash_table = AutoHashMap(u32, u16).init(allocator);
    defer hash_table.deinit();

    try hash_table.put(54321, 89);
    try hash_table.put(50050, 55);
    try hash_table.put(57709, 41);
    std.debug.print(
        "N of values stored: {d}\n",
        .{hash_table.count()}
    );
    std.debug.print(
        "Value at key 50050: {d}\n",
        .{hash_table.get(50050).?}
    );

    if (hash_table.remove(57709)) {
        std.debug.print(
            "Value at key 57709 succesfully removed!\n",
            .{}
        );
    }
    std.debug.print(
        "N of values stored: {d}\n",
        .{hash_table.count()}
    );
}
```

```
N of values stored: 3
Value at key 50050: 55
Value at key 57709 succesfully removed!
N of values stored: 2
```

You can add/put new values into the hashtable by using the `put()` method. The first argument
is the key to be used, and the second argument is the actual value that you want to store inside
the hashtable. In the example below, we first add the value 89 using the key 54321, next, we add
the value 55 using the key 50050, etc.

Notice that we used the method `count()` to see how many values are currently stored in the
hashtable. After that, we also used the `get()` method to access (or look) at the value stored in
the position identified by the key 500050. The output of this `get()` method is an optional value,
and that is why we use the `?` method at the end to get access to the actual value.

Also notice that we can remove (or delete) values from a hashtables by using the `remove()` method.
You provide the key that identifies the value that you want to delete, then, the method will
delete this value and return a `true` value as output. This `true` value essentially tells us
that the method succesfully deleted the value.

But this delete operation might not be always successful. For example, you might provide the wrong
key to this method. I mean, maybe you provide
(either intentionally or unintentionally) a key that points to an empty bucket,
i.e. a bucket that still doesn't have a value in it.
In this case, the `remove()` method would return a `false` value.



### Iterating through the hashtable

Iterating through the keys and values that are currently being stored in
the hashtable is a very commom need.
You can do that in Zig by using an iterator object that can iterate
through the elements of you hashtable object.

This iterator object works like any other iterator object that you would
find in languages such as C++ and Rust. It is basically a pointer object
that points to some value in the container, and has a `next()` method
that you can use to navigate (or iterate) through the next values in the
container.

You can create such iterator object by using the `iterator()` method of the hashtable object.
This method returns an iterator object, from which you can use the `next()` method in conjunction
with a while loop to iterate through the elements of your hashtable. The `next()` method returns an optional
`Entry` value, and therefore, you must unwrap this optional value to get the actual `Entry` value
from which you can access the key and also the value identified by this key.

With this `Entry` value at hand, you can access the key of this current entry by using the `key_ptr`
attribute and dereferencing the pointer that lives inside of it, while the value identified by this
key is accessed through the `value_ptr` attribute instead, which is also a pointer to be dereferenced.
The code example below demonstrates the use of these elements:


```{zig}
#| auto_main: false
const std = @import("std");
const AutoHashMap = std.hash_map.AutoHashMap;

pub fn main() !void {
    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};
    const allocator = gpa.allocator();
    var hash_table = AutoHashMap(u32, u16).init(allocator);
    defer hash_table.deinit();

    try hash_table.put(54321, 89);
    try hash_table.put(50050, 55);
    try hash_table.put(57709, 41);

    var it = hash_table.iterator();
    while (it.next()) |kv| {
        // Access the current key
        std.debug.print("Key: {d} | ", .{kv.key_ptr.*});
        // Access the current value
        std.debug.print("Value: {d}\n", .{kv.value_ptr.*});
    }
}
```

```
Key: 54321 | Value: 89
Key: 50050 | Value: 55
Key: 57709 | Value: 41
```


If you want to iterate through only the values or the keys of your hashtable,
you can create a key iterator or a value iterator object. These are also iterator
objects, which have the same `next()` method that you can use to iterate through the
sequence of values.

Key iterators are created from the `keyIterator()` method of your
hashtable object, while value iterators are created from the `valueIterator()` method.
All you have to do is to unwrap the value from the `next()` method and deference it
directly to access the key or value that you iterating over.
The code example below demonstrates what would this be for a key iterator,
but you can replicate the same logic to a value iterator.

```{zig}
#| eval: false
var kit = hash_table.keyIterator();
while (kit.next()) |key| {
    std.debug.print("Key: {d}\n", .{key.*});
}
```

```
Key: 54321
Key: 50050
Key: 57709
```


### The `ArrayHashMap` hashtable {#sec-array-map}

If you need to iterate through the elements of your hashtable constantly,
you might want to use the `ArrayHashMap` struct for your specific case,
instead of going with the usual and general-purpose `HashMap` struct.

The `ArrayHashMap` struct creates a hashtable that is faster to iterate over.
That is why this specific type of hashtable might be valuable to you.
Some other properties of a `ArrayHashMap` hashtable are:

- the order of insertion is preserved. So the order of the values you find while iterating through this hashtable
are actually the order in which these values were inserted in the hashtable.

- the key-value pairs are stored sequentially, one after another.


You can create an `ArrayHashMap` object by using, once again, a helper function that
chooses automatically for you a hash function implementation. This is the
`AutoArrayHashMap()` function, which works very similarly to the `AutoHashMap()`
function that we presented at @sec-hashmap.

You provide two data types to this function. The data type of the keys that will be
used in this hashtable, and the data type of the values that will be stored in
this hashtable.

An `ArrayHashMap` object have essentially the exact same methods from the `HashMap` struct.
So you can insert new values into the hashtable by using the `put()` method, you can look (or get)
a value from the hashtable by using the `get()` method. But the `remove()` method is not available
in this specific type of hashtable.

In order to delete values from the hashtable, you would use the same methods that you find in
an `ArrayList` object, i.e. a dynamic array. I presented these methods at @sec-dynamic-array-remove,
which are the `swapRemove()` and `orderedRemove()` methods. These methods have here the same meaning, or,
the same effect that they have in an `ArrayList` object.

This means that, with `swapRemove()` you remove the value from the hashtable, but you do not preserve
the order in which the values were inserted into the structure. While `orderedRemove()` is capable
of retaining the insertion order of these values.

But instead of providing an index as input to `swapRemove()` or `orderedRemove()`, like I described
at @sec-dynamic-array-remove, these methods here in an `ArrayHashMap` take a key as input, like
the `remove()` method from a `HashMap` object. If you want to provide an index as input, instead
of a key, you should use the `swapRemoveAt()` and `orderedRemoveAt()` methods.


```{zig}
#| eval: false
var hash_table = AutoArrayHashMap(u32, u16)
    .init(allocator);
defer hash_table.deinit();
```



### The `StringHashMap` hashtable {#sec-string-hash-map}

One thing that you will notice in the other two types of hashtables that I
presented in the last sections, is that neither of them accepts a slice data type
in their keys.
What this means is that you cannot use a slice value to represent a key in
these types of hashtable.

The most obvious consequence of this, is that you cannot use strings as keys
in these hashtables. But is extremely commom to use string values as keys
in hashtables.

Take this very simple Javascript code snippet as an example. We are creating
a simple hashtable object named `people`. Then, we add a new entry to this
hashtable, which is identified by the string `'Pedro'`. This string is the
key in this case, while the object containing different personal information such as
age, height and city, is the value to be stored in the hashtable.

```js
var people = new Object();
people['Pedro'] = {
    'age': 25,
    'height': 1.67,
    'city': 'Belo Horizonte'
};
```

This pattern of using strings as keys is very commom in
all sorts of situations. That is why the Zig Standard Library offers a
specific type of hashtable for this purpose, which is created through the `StringHashMap()` function.
This function creates a hashtable that uses strings as keys. The only input of this
function is the data type of the values that will be stored into this hashtable.

In the example below, I'm creating a hashtable to store the ages of different people.
The keys to be used in this hashtable are the names of each person, while the value stored in the
hashtable is the age of the person identified by the key.

That is why I provide the `u8` data type (which is the data type used by the age values) as input to this `StringHashMap()` function.
As the result, it creates a hashtable that uses string values as keys, and, that stores
`u8` values in it. Notice that an allocator object is provided at the `init()` method of the
resulting object from the `StringHashMap()` function.

```{zig}
#| auto_main: false
const std = @import("std");
pub fn main() !void {
    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};
    const allocator = gpa.allocator();
    var ages = std.StringHashMap(u8).init(allocator);
    defer ages.deinit();

    try ages.put("Pedro", 25);
    try ages.put("Matheus", 21);
    try ages.put("Abgail", 42);

    var it = ages.iterator();
    while (it.next()) |kv| {
        std.debug.print("Key: {s} | ", .{kv.key_ptr.*});
        std.debug.print("Age: {d}\n", .{kv.value_ptr.*});
    }
}
```

```
Key: Pedro | Age: 25
Key: Abgail | Age: 42
Key: Matheus | Age: 21
```


### The `StringArrayHashMap` hashtable

The Zig Standard Library also provides a type of hashtable that mix the cons and pros of the
types of hashtables that were presented on the previous two sections. That is, a hashtable
that uses strings as keys, but also have the advantages from the `ArrayHashMap` struct.
In other words, you can have a hashtable that is fast to iterate over,
that preserves insertion order, and also, that uses strings as keys.

You can create such type of hashtable by using the `StringArrayHashMap()` function.
This function accepts a data type as input, which is the data type of the values that are
going to be stored inside this hashtable, in the same style as the function presented
at @sec-string-hash-map.

You can insert new values into this hashtable by using the same `put()` method that
I presented at @sec-string-hash-map. And you can also get values from the hashtable
by using the same `get()` method that I exposed on previous sections.
Like it's `ArrayHashMap` brother, to delete values from this specific type of hashtable,
we also use the `orderedRemove()` and `swapRemove()` methods, with the same effects that
I described at @sec-array-map.

If we take the code example that was exposed at @sec-string-hash-map, we can
achieve the exact same result with `StringArrayHashMap()`. All we have to do
is to change the use of `StringHashMap()` to `StringArrayHashMap()` at the
fifth line in this code example. It would change to this:

```{zig}
#| eval: false
var ages = std.StringArrayHashMap(u8).init(allocator);
```



## Understanding `comptime` in Zig

One of the key features of Zig is `comptime`. This keyword introduces a whole
new concept and paradigm, that is tightly connected with the compilation process.
At @sec-compile-time we described the importance and the role that "compile-time vs runtime"
plays into Zig. At that section, we learned that the rules applied to a value/object change
a lot depending on whether this value is known at compile-time, or just at runtime.

The `comptime` keyword is strongly related to these two spaces of time in the compilation process,
i.e. the compile-time and the runtime. Let's quickly recap the differences. Compile-time is the period of time when your
Zig source code is being compiled by the `zig` compiler, while the runtime is
the period of time when your Zig program is being executed, i.e. when we execute
the binary files outputted by the `zig` compiler.

There are three ways in which you can apply the `comptime` keyword, which are:

- apply `comptime` on a function argument.
- apply `comptime` on an object.
- apply `comptime` on a block of expressions.



### Applying over a function argument

When you apply the `comptime` on a function argument you are saying to the `zig` compiler
that the value assigned to that particular argument of the function must be known at compile-time.
We explained in details at @sec-compile-time what exactly "value known at compile-time" means, so,
in case you have doubts about this idea, comeback to that section.

Now let's think about the consequences of this idea. First of all, we are imposing a limit, or, a requirement
to that particular function argument. If the programmer accidentally tries to give a value to this
function argument that is not known at compile time, the `zig` compiler will notice this problem, and
as a consequence, it will raise a compilation error saying that it cannot compile your program. Because
you are providing a value that is "runtime known" to a function argument that must be "compile-time known".

Take a look at this very simple example below, where we define a `double()` function, that simply
doubles the input value named `num`. Notice that, we use the `comptime` keyword before the name
of the function argument. This keyword is marking the function argument `num` as a "comptime argument".

That is a function argument whose value must be compile-time known. This is why the expression `double(5678)`
is valid, and no compilation errors are raised.
Because the value `5678` is compile-time known, so this is the expected behaviour for this function.

```{zig}
#| auto_main: false
#| build_type: "test"
fn double(comptime num: u32) u32 {
    return num * 2;
}
test "test comptime" {
    _ = double(5678);
}
```

But what if we provide a number that is not compile-time known to this function?
For example, we might provide a different input value to this function depending
on the target OS of our compilation process. The code example delow demonstrates such case.

Because the value of the object `n` is determined at runtime, we cannot provide this object
as input to the `double()` function. The `zig` compiler will not allow it, because we marked
the `num` argument as a "comptime argument". That is why the `zig` compiler raises
the compile-time error exposed below:

```{zig}
#| auto_main: false
#| build_type: "test"
const builtin = @import("builtin");
fn double(comptime num: u32) u32 {
    return num * 2;
}
test "test comptime" {
    var n: u32 = undefined;
    if (builtin.target.os.tag == .windows) {
        n = 1234;
    } else {
        n = 5678;
    }
    _ = double(n);
}
```

```
t.zig:12:16: error: runtime-known argument passed to comptime parameter
```

Comptime arguments are frequently used on functions that return some sort
of generic structure. In fact, `comptime` is the essence (or the basis) to make generics in Zig.
We are going to talk more about generics at @sec-generics.

For now, let's take a look at this code example from @karlseguin_generics. You
can see that this `IntArray()` function have one argument named `length`.
This argument is marked as comptime, and receives a value of type `usize` as input. So the value given to this argument
must be compile-time known.
We can also see that this function returns an array of `i64` values as output.

```{zig}
#| eval: false
fn IntArray(comptime length: usize) type {
    return [length]i64;
}
```

Now, the key component of this function is the `length` argument. This argument
is used to determine the size of the array that is produced by the function. Let's
think about the consequences of that. If the size of the array is dependent on
the value assigned to the `length` argument, this means that the data type of the
output of the function depends on the value of this `length` argument.

Let this statement sink for a bit in your mind. As I described at @sec-root-file,
Zig is a strongly-typed language, specially on function declarations.
So every time we write a function in Zig, we have to annotate the data type of
the value returned by the function. But how can we do that, if this data type
depends on the value given to the argument of the function?

Think about this for a second. If `length` is equal to 3 for example, then, the
return type of the function is `[3]i64`. But if `length` is equal to 40, then,
the return type becomes `[40]i64`. At this point the `zig` compiler would be confused,
and raise a compilation error, saying something like this:

> Hey! You have annotated that this function should return a `[3]i64` value, but I am seeing a `[40]i64` value instead! This doesn't look right!

So how can you solve this problem? How do we overcome this barrier? This is when
the `type` keyword comes in. This `type` keyword is basically saying to the
`zig` compiler that this function will return some type, but it doesn't know yet
what exactly type that is. We will talk more about this at @sec-generics.



### Applying over an expression

When you apply the `comptime` keyword over an expression, then, it is garanteed that the `zig` compiler will
execute this expression at compile-time. If for some reason, this expression cannot be executed at compile-time
(e.g. for example, maybe this expression depends on a value that is only known at runtime), then, the `zig` compiler
will raise a compilation error.

Take this example from the official documentation of Zig [@zigdocs]. We
are executing the same `fibonacci()` function both at runtime, and, at compile-time.
The function is by default executed at runtime, but because we use the `comptime`
keyword at the second "try expression", this expression is executed at compile-time.

This might be a bit confusing for some people. Yes! When I say that this expression
is executed at compile-time, I mean that this expression is compiled and executed
while the `zig` compiler is compiling your Zig source code.

If you think hard enough about how the C and C++ macros work, you can reach the conclusion
that they are also executed at compile-time. Because C and C++ macros are
just simple text replacements operations, that are performed at compile-time to form the final version
of the C or C++ source code that get's sent to the compiler.

```{zig}
#| auto_main: false
#| build_type: "test"
const expect = @import("std").testing.expect;
fn fibonacci(index: u32) u32 {
    if (index < 2) return index;
    return fibonacci(index - 1) + fibonacci(index - 2);
}

test "fibonacci" {
    // test fibonacci at run-time
    try expect(fibonacci(7) == 13);
    // test fibonacci at compile-time
    try comptime expect(fibonacci(7) == 13);
}
```

A lot of your Zig source code might be potentially executed at compile-time,
because the `zig` compiler can figure it out the result value of some types of expressions.
Specially if these expressions involves only compile-time known values.
We have talked about this at @sec-compile-time.

But when you use the `comptime` keyword on an expression, there is no "it might be executed
at compile-time" anymore. With the `comptime` keyword you are ordering the `zig` compiler
to execute this expression at compile-time. You are imposing this rule, it is garanteed
that the compiler will always execute it at compile-time. Or it at least, the compiler
will try to execute it. If the compiler cannot execute the expression for whatever reason,
the compiler will raise a compilation error.
