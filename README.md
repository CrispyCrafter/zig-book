Hey! This is the official repository for the book "Introduction to Zig: a project-based book", written by Pedro Duarte Faria.
This book is still under active development, and, as a result, it's content might change drastically in the near future.

The book is built using the publishing system [Quarto](https://quarto.org)
in conjunction with a little bit of R code (`zig_engine.R`), that is responsible for calling
the Zig compiler to compile and run the Zig code examples.
